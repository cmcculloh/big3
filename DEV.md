- [x] Workout/Routine Print View
        A workout routine needs to be printable. It should display in a simple list, something like this:

        [Routine Name] [Estimated Length] [Body Focus]
        [Exercise Name] [Suggested Weight] [Sets] [Reps] [Empty Checkbox for each set]
        [Exercise Name] [Suggested Weight] [Sets] [Reps] [Empty Checkbox for each set]

        Each row should alternate between white background and light grey.
        Exercises that should be done as alternating sets should share a background color and have a subtle top/bottom border
